## Intro

Farm is a super-fast web-building tool written in Rust. Benchmark against other tools (using Turbopack's benchmark, 1000 React components) as shown below:

> Test Repository: https://github.com/farm-fe/performance-compare

> Test Machine (Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon, 11th Gen Intel¬© Core‚Ñ¢ i5-11400 @ 2.60GHz √ó 6, 15.5 GiB)

<br />

## Features

- ‚ö° **Super Fast**: Written in Rust, start a React / Vue project in milliseconds and perform an HMR update within 10ms for most situations.
- üß∞ **Fully Pluggable**: Everything inside Farm is powered by plugins, achieve anything you want by creating a plugin. Supports both Rust and JavaScript plugins.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Powerful**: Compiles JS/TS/JSX/TSX, CSS, HTML, and static assets out of the box.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Lazy Compilation**: Dynamically imported resources are compiled only when requested.
- üì¶ **Partial Bundling**: Bundle your project into a few reasonable bundles, speeding up resource loading without losing caching granularity.
- üîí **Consistency**: What you see in development will be the same as what you get in production.
- üå≥ **Compatibility**: Supports both legacy (ES5) and modern browsers.

See [RFC-001](https://github.com/farm-fe/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/001-core-architecture/rfc.md#motivation) for design motivation and principles.

## RoadMap

Farm has implemented all features of a web build tool, including production optimization like tree shake and minification. We have already migrated enterprise projects to Farm, and it works great!

See [RoadMap](https://github.com/farm-fe/farm/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).
