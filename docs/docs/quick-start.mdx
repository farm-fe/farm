# Quick Start


:::warning Nightly Warning
If you are using version 2.0.0-nightly, please note the following:

- The Farm team is working hard on version 2.0. We have refactored the entire Node backend and added many practical features. Please check our RoadMap for future updates.

- This is a nightly build version that may contain new features and fixes that haven't been fully tested. As a result, unstable behavior or unexpected errors may occur.

- Since this version is in the development phase, features and APIs may change in future versions. Please regularly check the changelog for the latest information.

- We recommend against using this version in production environments unless you are prepared to handle potential issues.

If you encounter any problems, please feel free to create an Issue to provide feedback to us. Your feedback is crucial for improving Farm's functionality and stability.
and we will continue to update the documentation in the coming days. Thank you for your understanding and support.

## 2. Start the Project

Choose the package manager you like, install dependencies, then start the project.
Then, start the project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="cd farm-app && pnpm install && pnpm dev" />

> The project will start at `http://localhost:9000` by default.

## 3. Configuring the Project

The project is configured by `farm.config.ts/js/mjs` file in the root directory of the project.

```ts title="farm.config.ts" 
import { defineConfig } from "@farmfe/core";
import react from '@farmfe/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  // Additional plugins
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

:::note
See **[Configuring Farm](/docs/config/configuring-farm)** for details.
:::

## 4. Building the project

Build the Farm project as production-ready static files:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run build" />

The built product is downgraded to `ES2017` by default, and the product will be compressed and Tree Shake. If you want to preview the build product locally, you can execute `npm run preview` or `npx farm preview`.

:::note
See **[Build For Production](/docs/tutorials/build)** for details.

## 4. Preview the build products
