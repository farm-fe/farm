# NestJs

Create a `NestJs` project based on `Farm`.

`Farm` provides two approaches to support creating `NestJs` projects: 
- Use the `create-farm` scaffold to create a scaffold project
- You can manually create a `NestJs` project following the current documentation

### Creating a NestJs Project

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm create farm@latest" />

Select `NestJs` template in `Select Framework`

The nestjs project uses [farmup](https://github.com/farm-fe/farmup) to start and build the project. [Farmup](https://github.com/farm-fe/farmup) is built based on farm to simplify the way you run ts files in node js.

After downloading the template, run pnpm dev to start the nestjs project

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm run dev" />
