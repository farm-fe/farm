# Preact

Create a `Preact` project based on `Farm`.

`Farm` provides two approaches to support creating `Preact` projects: 
- Use the `create-farm` scaffold to create a scaffold project
- You can manually create a `Preact` project following the current documentation

### Creating a Preact Project

<PackageManagerTabs command="npm create farm@latest" />

Select `Preact` template in `Select Framework`

:::warning Preact
For `Preact` support, `Farm` recommends using `Vite` plugins.
:::

```javascript title="farm.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@farmfe/core';
import Preact from "vite-plugin-preact";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [Preact()],
});
```

If you want to start DevServer

<PackageManagerTabs command="pnpm dev" />

If you need to run the build production environment product command

<PackageManagerTabs command="pnpm build" />

If you need to preview your build product

<PackageManagerTabs command="pnpm preview" />
