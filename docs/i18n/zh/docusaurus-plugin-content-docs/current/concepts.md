# Concepts
Farm is a build tool to transform and bundle your `input` to `deployable resources`. Farm will search modules start from the input, then construct a module graph and bundle these modules into several `resources`

Main Concepts:
* **Input**
* **Output**
* **Plugins**
* **Partial Bundling**
