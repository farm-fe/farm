# Farm Core

Farm is a super-fast web build engine written in Rust. Farm can start a project in milliseconds and perform HMR within 5ms, making it much faster than similar tools like webpack and vite.

## Getting Started

Install Farm CLI:

```sh
npm install -g @farmfe/cli
```

We provide an example React project for now. Use `farm create` to create a new project and `farm start` to start the project.

```sh
farm create && cd farm-react && npm i && npm start
```
