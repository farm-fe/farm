# Farm Core

Farm is a Super fast web build engine written in Rust. Farm can start a project in milliseconds and perform a HMR within 5ms, much more faster than similar tools like webpack and vite.

See https://github.com/farm-fe/farm for details

## Getting Started

Install Farm Cli:

```sh
npm install -g @farmfe/cli
```

We provided a experience react project for now. Using `farm create` to create a new project. Using `farm start` to start the project.

```sh
farm create && cd farm-react && npm i && npm start
```
